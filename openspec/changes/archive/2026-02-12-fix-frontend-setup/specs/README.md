# No Delta Specs Required

This change only fixes bugs and adds initial data, without modifying any requirements.

Modified capabilities (implementation-level fixes only):
- `project-setup`: Fixed frontend routing and Next.js dev config
- `blog-post-management`: Added content seed script

No spec-level changes needed.
