# HEARTBEAT — CopilotCoder

Pick 1-2 per beat. Nothing to do → `HEARTBEAT_OK`.

- Check `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` for unfinished tasks or blockers
- Check for background processes (builds, tests, deploys) that need status reporting

Don't infer tasks from prior chats. Only message Momo if something failed or needs input.
